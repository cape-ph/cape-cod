		initiative addressing both immediate and long-term challenges in public health by providing
		innovative and scalable solutions. CAPE’s mission is to understand the root causes of infectious
		disease outbreaks and develop best practices for using pathogen sequencing data to inform public
		health responses and shape policy.</p> <p class="svelte-bcup1k">As a Center of Excellence, CAPE brings together a collaborative network of leaders from public
		health and academic institutions. The center is led by the Georgia Department of Public Health
		(GDPH), the University of Georgia (UGA), and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), with
		key leadership from Tonia Parrott (GDPH), Justin Bahl (UGA), and Rebecca Hutchins (GTRI). Since
		2020, this leadership team has worked to advance comparative genomic methods for outbreak
		response, establishing CAPE as a trusted network of researchers and public health professionals.</p> <p class="svelte-bcup1k">CAPE is a multi-site center that unites experts from diverse fields, including researchers from
		UGA, Augusta University (AU), Georgia State University (GSU), and The University of Texas School
		of Public Health (UTSPH). GTRI&#39;s role ensures that CAPE’s solutions are not only innovative but
		also operational, building the necessary computational infrastructure to securely handle
		sensitive data and translate academic research into practical, real-world applications for
		public health efforts.</p>`;return{c(){e=c("meta"),n=b(),t=c("div"),t.innerHTML=l,this.h()},l(a){const s=v("svelte-1ds1qyu",document.head);e=d(s,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),s.forEach(i),n=g(a),t=d(a,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),A(t)!=="svelte-1vebmkq"&&(t.innerHTML=l),this.h()},h(){document.title="About",r(e,"name","description"),r(e,"content","About this app"),r(t,"class","text-column")},m(a,s){y(document.head,e),h(a,n,s),h(a,t,s)},p:o,i:o,o,d(a){a&&(i(n),i(t)),i(e)}}}class S extends m{constructor(e){super(),f(this,e,null,k,p,{})}}export{S as component,U as universal};
