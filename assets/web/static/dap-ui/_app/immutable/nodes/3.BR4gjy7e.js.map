CAPE’s mission is to understand the root causes of infectious\n\t\tdisease outbreaks and develop best practices for using pathogen sequencing data to inform public\n\t\thealth responses and shape policy.\n\t</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs a Center of Excellence, CAPE brings together a collaborative network of leaders from public\n\t\thealth and academic institutions. The center is led by the Georgia Department of Public Health\n\t\t(GDPH), the University of Georgia (UGA), and the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), with\n\t\tkey leadership from Tonia Parrott (GDPH), Justin Bahl (UGA), and Rebecca Hutchins (GTRI). Since\n\t\t2020, this leadership team has worked to advance comparative genomic methods for outbreak\n\t\tresponse, establishing CAPE as a trusted network of researchers and public health professionals.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tCAPE is a multi-site center that unites experts from diverse fields, including researchers from\n\t\tUGA, Augusta University (AU), Georgia State University (GSU), and The University of Texas School\n\t\tof Public Health (UTSPH). GTRI's role ensures that CAPE’s solutions are not only innovative but\n\t\talso operational, building the necessary computational infrastructure to securely handle\n\t\tsensitive data and translate academic research into practical, real-world applications for\n\t\tpublic health efforts.\n\t</p>\n</div>\n\n<style>\n\tp {\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 1.5em;\n\t}\n</style>\n"],"names":["DEV","dev","csr","prerender","append_hydration","meta","insert_hydration","target","div","anchor"],"mappings":"wLACO,MAAMA,EAAM,GCINC,EAAMD,ECDNE,EAAMD,EAINE,EAAY;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0ZCNxBC,EAAmD,SAAA,KAAAC,CAAA,WAGpDC,EA2BKC,EAAAC,EAAAC,CAAA","x_google_ignoreList":[0,1]}
