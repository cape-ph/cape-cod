#       processed and nothing else. The file consists of:
#       - a 2 column header row that contains a column (0 index) with the alert
#         report date, which we need (rest of this row can be ignored)
#       - another header row that contains all the column names for the table
#       - rows of data

# now perform the ETL on the data rows
# NOTE: Questions about the data:
#           - Do we need to split this name to better enable queries later?
#           - will the name only ever be composed of first and last (i.e. no
#             middle name handling)?
#           - do we not want the lab id to carry over into clean data? same
#             with organism id (and anything else that doesn't carry over
#             currently). there's very little penalty (storage cost) for it
#             carrying over, and if it's not part of the AR log, we just don't
#             include it in the AR query, but we still have it if we end up
#             needing it for anything else
